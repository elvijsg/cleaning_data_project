1. Codebook.md: Describes how to use the provided files, details the variables, the data, and any transformations or work done to clean the data.
2. run_analysis.R: Contains the code to perform the analysis in five steps:

   2.1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.

   2.2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

   2.3.Uses descriptive activity names to label the activities in the data set.
 
  2.4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 
  2.5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, based on the data set from step 2.4.

finaltidydata.txt: The output file from the final step.
